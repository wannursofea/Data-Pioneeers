# JaminBelaja
Our app provides essential educational resources and interactive support for students affected by natural disasters. Through its online textbook library, students can easily access subject-specific content across various topics, enabling them to continue their studies without disruption. In addition, the app offers a ‘Post & Answer’ section, which functions as a community-driven Q&A platform where users can ask questions, share insights, and receive support from peers—much like Reddit. Finally, each subject includes dedicated exercise sections, allowing students to reinforce their knowledge and track their progress effectively. By combining accessible educational materials, community engagement, and practice exercises, our platform aims to offer a comprehensive learning solution that addresses both academic needs and peer interaction.
